# Track 1: Foundation Research TODO

## RIFTlang Semantic Token Architecture
- [ ] Research triplet model: (token_memory, token_type, token_value)
- [ ] Study memory-first token architecture principles
- [ ] Document Bayesian DAG resolution engine
- [ ] Analyze isomorphic reduction for semantic governance

## Single-Pass Compilation Research
- [ ] Document "one pass, no recursion" implementation
- [ ] Study tokenizer → parser → AST pipeline
- [ ] Research prevention of recursive dependencies
- [ ] Analyze semantic minimalism enforcement

## Memory Governance Contracts
- [ ] Research memory as governance contract principle
- [ ] Study role-based memory access control
- [ ] Document span<row>, span<fixed>, span<superposed> patterns
- [ ] Analyze zero-trust memory model

## Policy-Driven Concurrency
- [ ] Study "concurrency as rhythm" implementation
- [ ] Document policy mutex systems
- [ ] Research thread-safe semantic preservation
- [ ] Analyze formal mathematical models for safety
