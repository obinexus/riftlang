# RIFTLang

*A programming language for governance-first computation.*  
**Code how you live** - with care, with autonomy, with clarity.

## ? What Is RIFT?

RIFT is not just a language - it's a governance ecosystem.

Born from failure - medical hardware that couldn't be trusted, developers who weren't listened to, and systems that forgot to care - RIFTLang is a new computing philosophy designed to ensure:

- What runs is safe  
- What's written is intentional  
- What's stored is yours  

> **"We compile what has been governed."**

---

## ?? Core Concepts

- `.rift` files define policies that govern compilation.
- Components can be written in any language, but linked through **Gossi drivers**.
- RIFT follows **The RIFTer's Way** - a manifesto of intentional design, respectful concurrency, and thread-safe logic.

---

## ?? Key Principles

- **Interference** - Allocate bits before you compute. No ambiguity.
- **Substitution** - Encode without mutation. Wrap meaning with intent.
- **Entanglement** - Synchronize buffers like shared memory across dimensions.
- **Superposition** - Mount entropy to memory. Register it for reuse.

> Every file is a breath.  
> Every token, a truth.

## ?? Components

- **LibRIFT** - Pattern matching and type wrapping  
- **NLINK** - Policy-aware linker  
- **GossiLang** - Gossip-powered polyglot binding  
- **Rift.exe / LRift.so** - The compiler and the enforcer

---

## ?? `Import(disk)`

Not data - **meaning**.

Resuming a session in RIFT restores context, not just memory.  
It's a declarative restoration of intention.

> You don't just load a file - you restore a breath you left behind.

## ?? Documentation

- *The RIFTer's Way Manifesto*  
- *Base Shift Allocator Spec*  
- *Quantum Interference System*

## ??? Status

?? Early development.  
? Structure in place.  
?? Meaning under construction.

## ?? License

**MIT** - because the code should be free,  
but never reckless.
